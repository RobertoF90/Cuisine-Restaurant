Link to project: --coming soon--

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on building a website from a pre-made layout while adding some personal touch.

Optimizations

To improve this project, I want to add queries to CSS to make it available on all devices. I also want to work on some interactivity with JavaScript.

Lessons Learned:

I learned how to implement the latest version of Fontawesome and practiced inserting and styling icons.
